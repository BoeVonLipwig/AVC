This was an engineering first-year group project to build and code a self-steering robot that would be capable of solving a maze consisting of taped out paths. 
This involved:
  Writing code for a PID steering system based on a camera input
  Team based work
  Keeping detailed documentation and writing a report to summarise our actions and decisions over the course of the project
  Working with a Raspberry Pi (With wireless capability’s) and attached PCB(Including an H bridge for motor control)
  A lite amount of 3d modelling and printer work
This was a group project written in C and is not representative of the current coding abilities of the individual’s involved
